# KISA - WIP and still terrible.
Keep It Simple Animatronics

This project is intended for beginners to animatronics so they can build, program, record, and playback an animatronic project. It is currently very much a work in project and does not do much.

I got sick of not finding any good ways to control a waldo and program and record a series of motions without having to spend money on bad/old software. So I decided to build my own. 

I am supporting pi zero w's currently because I am using them, but am open to expanding if given a little help.
